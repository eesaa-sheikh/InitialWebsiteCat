            <h2>Why I think cats are the best pets to have </h2>

            <p>Bringing a new cat or kitten into your home and allowing them to meet your resident cat can be 
                <br>quite a nerve-racking experience. It always helps to be well prepared and youâ€™ll want to 
                <br>give the introduction process quite a lot of thought beforehand to ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible.

                <br><br>Introducing too quickly with little preparation will often lead to cats feeling threatened and scared, which 
                <br>increases the chance of aggressive behaviour being shown. Once cats feel this way about each other, it can be extremely 
                <br>difficult to change their minds. A slow and careful introduction using this leaflet as a guide will hopefully prevent 
                <br>this from happening at all, and should lead to a peaceful co-existence for all concerned. </p>

                <h3>British Shorthair</h3>
                <p>The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, 
                <br> dense coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, orange 
                <br>eyes, and a medium-sized tail.</p>

                <p>The Persian cat, also known as the Persian longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by a round face and short 
                <br>muzzle. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy from Persia around 1620.</p>
